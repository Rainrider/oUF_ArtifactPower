# oUF ArtifactPower

## Description

oUF ArtifactPower is an element plug-in for the unitframe framework [oUF](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info9994-oUF.html).  
It requires a oUF layout that supports it.

## Features

  - Shows the current artifact/azerite power as a status bar.

  - Optionally show a tooltip when hovered.
  - Optionally fades the bar in and out if it is mouse enabled and the .onAlpha and .offAlpha options are set by the layout.
