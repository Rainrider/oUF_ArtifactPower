# oUF ArtifactPower

## Description

oUF ArtifactPower is an element plug-in for the unitframe framework [oUF](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info9994-oUF.html).  
It requires a oUF layout that supports it.

## Features

  - Shows the artifact power for the currently equipped artifact weapon as a status bar.
  - Optionally shows a tooltip when hovered, containing the name of the currently equipped artifact as well as the unspent, current and remaining power until the next trait can be purchased. The tooltip also tells how many traits are purchasable with the unspent artifact power.
  - Optionally fades the bar in and out if it is mouse enabled and the .onAlpha and .offAlpha options are set by the layout.
  - Hides the bar if the player is in a vehicle or has no artifact equipped.
